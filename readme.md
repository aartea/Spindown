##Research Plan Worksheet

1. All-encompassing Life Counter for Android.
2. Mutility iOS looking for an Android equivalent. None exist or those that did were feature light.
3. Provide a free Life Counter (MTG, Stretch: YGOh & MTG Booster Draft) Android solution.
4. 
	a. What can a user expect?
	b. What does the user gain from my app?
	c. Does this app make it easier to track life?
5. TCG players; especially MTG (Stretch: YGOh)
6. 
	a. What makes MTG difficult for you?
	b. How would a free counter app be of use to you?

##Research Plan Worksheet

- 1) Research Title:
	- All-encompassing Life Counter for Android.
- 2) Authors:
	- Winston Chang
	- Aaron Artea
- 4) Background:
	- Mutility iOS inspired me to find a comparable Android equivalent. None exist or those that did were feature light in the areas that made Mutility such a greater user experience.
- 5) Goals:
	- Provide a free Life Counter (MTG, Stretch: YGOh & MTG Booster Draft) Android solution.
- 6) Research Questions:
	- What can a user expect?
	- What does the user gain from my app?
	- Does this app make it easier to track life?
	- Does this app make chaos games more bearable?
- 8) Participants / Target Audience: 
	- TCG players; especially MTG (Stretch: YGOh)
- 10) 
	- What makes MTG difficult for you?
	- How would a free life tracking app be of use to you?
